# Parametric Insurance dApp

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) for parametric insurance using Ethereum, Solidity, and React. The application allows users to purchase insurance policies based on predefined weather conditions and automatically processes payouts when those conditions are met.

## Features

- **Purchase Policies**: Users can purchase insurance policies by paying a premium.
- **Automated Payouts**: Payouts are triggered automatically based on weather data fetched from an oracle.
- **Blockchain Technology**: Uses Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts for secure and transparent transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum**: For decentralized transaction processing.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Truffle**: Development environment and testing framework for Ethereum.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parametric-insurance-dapp.git
   cd parametric-insurance-dapp


Install dependencies:
npm install
Compile and deploy contracts:
truffle compile
truffle migrate
Run the frontend:
npm start
Usage
Ensure you have MetaMask installed and configured to connect to your local Ethereum network or testnet.
Use the application to purchase policies and simulate payouts based on oracle data.

### Final Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Initialize your local directory as a Git repository and push it to GitHub.

2. **Test and Deploy**:
   - Make sure everything works locally before deploying to a live environment or testnet.
   - Conduct security audits for the smart contract if necessary.

### Notes

- The oracle integration here is conceptual. You will need to replace the placeholder functions and address with actual Blocksense SDK functionality once you have access to their documentation.
- Ensure that the MetaMask extension is installed and configured correctly to interact with your dApp.
